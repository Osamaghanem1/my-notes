The article explains the fundamentals of a good developer mindset, and discusses common issues faced by developers while developing software and how they can avoid them by embracing the fundamental laws of software. It highlights the purpose of software, which is to help people and not to show off one's intelligence. The text stresses the importance of designing systems that can be created and maintained easily by developers to ensure that they continue to be helpful. It emphasizes the need to understand the systems and tools that developers work with and the act of reducing complexity to simplicity. The article suggests that the complexity of a system can be controlled by creating simple designs and avoiding unnecessary features, which can harm the software in the long run.

And here is the main rules that I have Learned: 
1. Resistance to (unnecessary) change.
2. When you are convinced that this change is a need
3. Your main purpose is to control complexity, not to create it.
4. Think before acting.
5. It is more important to reduce the effort of maintenance than it is to reduce the effort of implementation.
6. The equation of priority  is simple: D=V/E
7. Start small, improve it, then extend.
8. Don’t predict to future. Be only as generic as you know you need to be right now.
9. Don’t reinvent the wheel.
10. Code should be designed based on what you know now, not on what you think will happen in the future.
 11. remember your software purpose. Then remember the simple equation in prioritizing section.
12. If you can automate it, automate it.
13. The optimum code is a small bunch of code that is easy to understand, easy to read.
 14. “How can I write more code?” rather it should be “How can I remove more code?”

15. Untested code is the code that doesn’t work.

16. Everything takes longer than you think.

17. Refactoring should be the first option.

18. Write a comment to explain “WHY”, not to explain “WHAT”.
Know that every specific problem has its own specific solution.

19. Don’t be obsessive. Know when to quit. Don’t hesitate to ask for help.
